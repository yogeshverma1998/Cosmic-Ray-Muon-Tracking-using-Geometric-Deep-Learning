# Cosmic Ray Muon Tracking using Geometric Deep Learning

Tracking cosmic ray muons in a 3-D Scintillator detector simulated using GEANT-4. The approach is based on using geometric deep learning a.k.a Graph Neural Networks by creating a undirected graph of hitpoints in the detector. The work is accpeted in XXIV DAE-BRNS High Energy Physics Symposium for [Poster](https://www.niser.ac.in/daehep2020/posters.php) Presentation.
