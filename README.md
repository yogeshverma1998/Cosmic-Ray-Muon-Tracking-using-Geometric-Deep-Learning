# Particle Track Reconstruction using Geometric Deep Learning

Tracking cosmic ray muons in a 3-D Scintillator detector simulated using GEANT-4 and air showers created using CORSIKA. The approach is based on using geometric deep learning a.k.a Graph Neural Networks by creating a undirected graph of hitpoints in the detector. The work is accpeted in XXIV DAE-BRNS High Energy Physics Symposium for [:bar_chart:](https://www.niser.ac.in/daehep2020/posters.php) Presentation and availiable on [:page_facing_up:](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.08515).
